# Stats
OS X utility that gives important statistics right in the status bar.

## Installation
For now, you must have Xcode to install. Here are the steps:

1. Build the product with âŒ˜B or Product -> Build.
2. Right click Stats.app in the Products folder in Xcode and click "Show in Finder".
3. Copy Stats.app from its location in Finder and paste it into /Applications.

If you would like to have Stats run on startup, the easiest way is to open System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Items and add Stats.app there.
